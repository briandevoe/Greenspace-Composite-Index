## 1. Purpose and Motivation

Existing child opportunity and environmental indices often rely on **cross-sectional** or **city-level** measures of greenness (e.g., NatureScore). They lack a consistent, **longitudinal, census-tractâ€“scale** measure, limiting our ability to understand how changing vegetation and park access affect health and opportunity over time.

Developing a yearly tract-level greenness time series will enable:
- Detection of **spatial and temporal trends** in vegetation (e.g., canopy growth or loss, post-disaster recovery).  
- Integration with **annual health and socioeconomic indicators** (e.g., life expectancy, obesity, mental health).  
- Application of **panel modeling frameworks** (e.g., fixed-effects or lagged exposure models) that exploit within-tract change.

## 2. Data Sources

| **Indicator** | **Dataset / Source** | **Notes** |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| NDVI & EVI | Landsat Surface Reflectance â€“ USGS | Annual/seasonal composites (30 m); cloud-masked and harmonized via Earth Engine |
| Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) | USDA Forest Service Tree Canopy Cover | 30 m gridded canopy fraction (1985â€“2023) |
| Land Cover Classes | USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) | Used to compute % vegetated area (forest, grass, shrub, wetland) |
| Park Proximity / Access | PAD-US-AR (Browning et al., 2022), ParkServe, CDC-derived park data | Percent of tract (and 0.5 mi buffer) considered park area |
| Geographies | Census Tracts, Block Groups, Counties â€” U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line | Consistent 2020 boundaries across years |

**Potential additions:** Sentinel-2 indices (10 m), MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (250 m), Global Forest Change, or population-weighted greenness exposures (LandScan / WorldPop).

## 3. Data Harmonization and Aggregation Process

### Goal
Create a uniform, yearly *greenness stack* â€” all indicators aligned to the same spatial grid â€” and compute tract-level summaries via zonal statistics.

### Why Raster Harmonization?
All major inputs (NDVI, EVI, TCC, Land Cover) are raster-based.  
Aligning them to a single **30 m Albers Equal Area (EPSG:5070)** grid ensures every pixel represents the same footprint across datasets and years.  
This prevents spatial mismatch and allows reproducible tract, block-group, or county aggregation.

### Process Overview
1. **Define a master grid**
   - CRS: EPSG 5070 (Albers Equal Area)
   - Resolution: 30 m  
   - Alignment: Match base NDVI mosaic
2. **Resample each input raster**
   - Continuous layers (NDVI, EVI, TCC): Bilinear resampling  
   - Categorical layers (land cover): Nearest neighbor  
   - Park polygons: Rasterized to fractional % coverage per 30 m pixel
3. **Stack and harmonize**
   - Build annual raster stacks or VRTs with identical extent, resolution, and nodata masks  
   - Optionally store as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs
4. **Zonal aggregation**
   - Overlay Census Tract polygons  
   - Compute mean NDVI, mean EVI, mean TCC, % vegetated area, % park area (and 0.5-mi buffer variant)  
   - Output one record per tract per year, including coverage diagnostics

**Outcome:**  
A tract-year panel dataset (~70 k tracts Ã— 20 years â‰ˆ 1.4 M records) providing consistent greenness metrics across time, ready for index construction and validation.

## 4. Challenges in Harmonization

- **Temporal mismatch:** Different update frequencies (Landsat yearly, NLCD every 2â€“3 years).  
- **Boundary drift:** Changing Census tract definitions (2010 â†’ 2020) require harmonized boundary crosswalks.  
- **Resolution conflicts:** Reprojecting 10 mâ€“250 m sources to a common 30 m grid.  
- **Missing or cloud-masked pixels:** Need valid-pixel thresholds or interpolation.  
- **Rural extremes:** Extremely high greenness may dominate scales â€” apply top-coding?  
- **Processing scale:** National mosaics require efficient parallel/tiled processing (e.g., VRT + windowed reads).

## 5. Methods and Weighting Strategy

### Index Construction
- **Equal-weight baseline:** Each standardized indicator contributes equally.  
- **Expert-weight model:** Emphasize tree canopy and park proximity.  
- **PCA-weighted model:** Use unsupervised PCA loadings (PC1) to derive empirical weights and reduce collinearity.

### Validation
Use tract-level health and well-being data:
- CDC PLACES (obesity, mental health, physical activity)  
- NCHS life expectancy  
- EPA AQS (air quality, asthma)  
- SEDA test scores (education outcomes)  

Evaluate via correlations, regression RÂ², predictive validity, and spatial residual diagnostics.  
Select the index version balancing interpretability and predictive performance.

## 6. Expected Deliverables

- Annual tract-level CSV + GPKG files (2000â€“present) â€” *for this class, one year of data*  
- Technical documentation describing harmonization and weighting  
- Validation tables/figures linking greenness to health outcomes  
- Reproducible scripts (Python + Earth Engine) for future updates
